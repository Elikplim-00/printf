Project Readme: Custom Printf Function
Description

This project aims to guide you through the process of creating your own printf function in the C programming language. The printf function is a powerful and widely used function in C that allows developers to format and print output to the console or other output streams. By understanding how printf works under the hood, you'll gain valuable insights into string formatting, memory management, and variadic functions in C.

Features

    Format specifiers: Implement support for %d, %f, %c, %s, and %x format specifiers.
    Width and precision: Allow specifying field width and precision in the format string.
    Variadic function: Create a variadic function that accepts a variable number of arguments.
    Basic error handling: Handle some basic error scenarios gracefully.

Usage

The custom printf function will be implemented in the custom_printf.c source file. To use the function in your own programs, follow these steps:

    Include the custom_printf.h header file in your source file where you want to use the custom printf function.
    Compile the custom_printf.c file along with your source file.
    Call the custom_printf function in your code, just like you would use the standard printf.
